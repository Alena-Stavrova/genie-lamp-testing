Before doing any testing, a tester should become familiar with the relevant documentation (requirements, specification). 

Obviously, there is nothing like that for a genie lamp and I had to do my research. It turned out, the requirements are not that clear and may differe depeding on the source of the story (e.g. amounts of wishes, owners, restrictions etc.).

For the purpose of this project, I will accept the following as the valid requirements:

1. The genie lamp looks like an oil lamp but has a genie in it.
2. When someone rubs the lamp (= Lamp Owner), the genie appears.
3. The genie can grant the Lamp Owner three wishes. 
4. Restrictions on wishes:
•	no killing people, including indirectly (e.g. initiating a car crash)
•	no making someone fall in love 
•	no resurrection 
•	no wishing for more wishes
5. The Lamp Owner can set the genie free by using one of his/her wishes for that.
6. After three wishes have been granted to the Lamp Owner, the genie goes back to the lamp (unless set free).
7. Any number of people can become Lamp Owners after that.
