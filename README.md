# genie-lamp-testing

In this project, I will test a genie lamp ðŸ§ž. I got the idea from your typical "testing a pencil" tasks for novice testers, but I wanted to make it more interesting. Initially, I wanted to write a test plan, but then I realized that the most interesting part is testing the "documentation". 

Why test a genie lamp?
<ul>* fun!</ul>
<ul>* no technical expertise needed</ul>
<ul>* rules are relatively simple (or are they? ðŸ˜ˆ)</ul>
<ul>* many people are familiar with the story</ul>
<ul>* great exercise in analytical thinking</ul>
