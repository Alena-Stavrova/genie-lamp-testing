# test-plan-project

In this project, I will test documentation and create a plan for a genie lamp ðŸ§ž. I got the idea from your typical "testing a pencil" tasks for novice tester, but I wanted to make it more interesting.

Why testing a genie lamp?
<ul>* fun!</ul>
<ul>* no technical expertise needed</ul>
<ul>* rules are relatively simple and straightforward (or are they?)</ul>
<ul>* many people are familiar with the story</ul>
<ul>* great exercise in analytical thinking</ul>

We'll see, maybe I will test some more magic items in the future, but for now, I'll focus on this one.
