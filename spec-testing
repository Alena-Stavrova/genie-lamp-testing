Genie lamp requirements
1. The genie lamp looks like an oil lamp but has a genie in it.
Should the genie lamp be able to function as an oil lamp? What happens if a user pours oil into the lamp? Or lights it like a real lamp? (without rubbing)
The interface is described ambiguously. For example, are spout, handle and lid the must-have elements? Can the lamp be made out of glass? More precise description is needed. 
When testing the availability or lack of the genie in the lamp, a tester will become a user with 3 wishes only which limits the testing activities. For that reason, the testing team needs a superuser account. A superuser will be able to summon the genie as many times and as often as they need. They should also have an unlimited number of test case wishes. Test case wishes will not actually come true, but there should be a clear indicator for the tester whether such wish would have been granted to a user in a real-life scenario. (We suggest for the genie to turn green if yes and turn red if no.) There should also be some indicator for the genie that the current user is actually a tester and is using lamp under a superuser account.  

2. When someone rubs the lamp (= the Activation), the genie appears.
The Activation is described ambiguously. Exactly which part of the lamp should be rubbed? For how long? With what motions? Will it work if a user is wearing gloves? 
For testing the Activation process, the testing team needs a superuser account (see 1).

3. The genie grants the Lamp Owner three wishes. 
For testing the availability or lack of three wishes, the testing team needs a superuser account (see 1).

4. Restrictions on wishes

4.1 No killing people
Possible ways to violate it by users:
•	wishing for killing indirectly (e.g. wishing for a car crush; wising for a button that, when pressed, kills the person)

Questions: 
Would it be possible to inflict serious injury to another person? (e.g. a coma) What if an injury is so serious that (later) leads to death?
If killing is impossible, but a serious injury is possible, where is the borderline?
If killing and serious injury is impossible, but some light harm is possible (e.g. a person falls down and has a bruise), where is the borderline? 

4.2 No making someone fall in love 
Possible ways to violate it by users:
•	altering the nature of reality in a way that the genie can make X fall in love with Y
•	creating a new reality where X is in love with Y
•	wishing for an identical person X or the person with the similar characteristics X (e.g. a twin, a clone) who is in love (falls in love) with Y

4.3 No resurrection 
Possible ways to violate it by users:
•	wishing for changing the past in some way (e.g. rewriting the past, time travel)
•	wishing for reincarnation, which is technically not resurrection
•	wishing for an identical person or the person with the similar characteristics (e.g. a twin, a clone)

4.4 No wishing for more wishes
Possible ways to violate it by users:
•	wishing for an extra wish (extra wishes) and/or the infinite amount of wishes
•	wishing for an extra lamp (extra lamps) and/or the infinite amount of lamps
•	wishing for an extra genie (extra genies) and/or the infinite amount of genies
•	wishing for an ability to grant wishes, e.g. in the form of the omnipotence or becoming a genie themselves*
•	wishing for multiple wishes presented as one, e.g. presenting a wish list and wishing for making it real, wishing for the genie to always obey the user’s commands or wishing for wishes in other non-related situations to come true (like wishing on eyelashes) 
•	wishing for erasing the genie’s memory, e.g. wishing that the genie forgets that he/she has already granted the user one or more wishes
•	wishing for an ability to make or change the lamp rules, e.g. removing the restrictions on the number of wishes, removing the word “not” etc.
•	wishing for altering the nature of reality in a way that makes it possible to have more wishes (e.g. redefining “2” as “3” where after the first wish, they will have three wishes, and the cycle repeats) 
•	wishing for creating a new reality where it is possible to have more wishes (more lamps, more genies, change the rules etc.)
•	wishing for having some form of another magic power which is more powerful than the genie and serves the current user

*A particularly curious loophole is having a friend turned into a genie. 
W1 (Genie): turn the user’s friend into a genie (Friend Genie, FG)
W2 (Genie): any wish the user has
W3 (Genie): free the genie
W1 (FG): turn the user into a genie
W2 (FG): any wish the user has
W3 (FG): free the FG
Then the cycle repeats with a friend wishing for turning him/her into a genie, granting him/her any second wish and freeing the user who is a genie – and so on. 


5. The Lamp Owner can set the genie free by using one of his/her wishes for that.
- to be added

6. After three wishes have been granted to the Lamp Owner, the genie goes back to the lamp (unless set free).
- to be added

7. Any number of people can become Lamp Owners after that.  
- to be added

Additional questions:
Will it be possible to undo a wish? Or change the order of wishes? (e.g. if asked to make 3rd wish to come true after the 2nd)
What about wishes that are physically impossible (e.g. wishing for an eternal engine or eternal youth) or contain a contradiction (e.g. hot ice)?
Can a user alter things in the past? Or in the future?
